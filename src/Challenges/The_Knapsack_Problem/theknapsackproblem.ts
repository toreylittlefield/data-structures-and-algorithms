 * Imagine that you’re a thief breaking into a house. There are so many valuables to steal
 * - diamonds, gold, jewelry, and more! But remember, you’re just one person who can only carry so much.
 * Each item has a weight and value, and your goal is to maximize the total value of items while
 * remaining within the weight limit of your knapsack.
